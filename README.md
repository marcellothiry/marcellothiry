### Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Marcello Thiry and I have more than 35 years of experience in software development, as a professor, consultant, and practitioner. 

My goal here is to learn, share knowledge, help other developers to improve their skills and have fun in the process.

If you are interested, I've just started a YouTube channel: [@fromDev2Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@fromDev2Dev).

Cheers
